Description: Provides a lightweight (zero-dependency) and easy to use 
    unit testing framework. Main features: install tests with 
    the package. Test results are treated as data that can be stored and manipulated. 
    Test files are R scripts interspersed with test commands, that can be programmed
    over. Fully automated build-install-test sequence for packages. Skip tests when
    not run locally (e.g. on CRAN). Flexible and configurable output printing. Compare
    computed output with output stored with the package.
